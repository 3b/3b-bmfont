#### readers/writers for bmfont metadata file formats

currently reads/writes text and xml formats, and bmfont-like json
format used by some js libs. Tries to handle some extensions,
including `distanceField` used by msdf-bmfont-xml.

API will probably change, file an issue or tell me on IRC if you want
a stable API sooner.
